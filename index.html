  <p>The web is made up of <em>structured documents</em> written in a form computers can understand called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a></p
  >

  <p>The Web includes HTML documents, as well as music, videos, images, and other files that are stored on servers and read by our web browser via a protocol called 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a>.</p>
  <p><b>HTML</b> include the text that will be visible, plus the markup that makes that text appear certain ways.</p>

  <p>There is also another language called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> that allows further customization of the appearance of web pages and we will learn about it later in the NanoDegree. </p>

<span><b>HTML</b> includes tags that contain content as well as void tags <br>

  that do not contain content.
</span>

<span>Tags can be either inline such as <em>span</em> or <em>img</em> which means they appear inline like this <img src="https://lh6.ggpht.com/gzcZTQuXefPLSSaKithiGKzP5vcc_Gs-CbJjmuCTIn-YLsjzjvyWyBwnDXa-dVOf9EbOX03va4jFTdD4_w=s80#w=1800&h=1800"> </span><br>

<p> or they can be block such as the <em>p</em> tag which creates an invisible block around the element</p>

<div>There are also container tags like <em>div</em> that allow us to add attributes and style certain areas of a document.</div>
